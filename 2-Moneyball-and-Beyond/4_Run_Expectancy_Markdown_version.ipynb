        "## Context\n",
        "\n",
        "In the previous sessions we compared player abilities using season-long averages. The capacity to reach bases *on average* is a reasonable measure of ability given the large number of appearances of the better players. However, an average of this kind is independent of context. To take an extreme example, On Base Percentage (OBP) gives as much credit to a walk when there are no runners on the bases as it does to a walk when bases are loaded, which produces an additional run. A lot of statistical analysis in baseball seeks to take account of the context of an event: a hit is more valuable in some circumstances than in others.\n",

        "## Run Expectancy\n",
        "\n",
        "Run expectancy is a very powerful framework for identifying certain aspects of performance. Specifically, run expectancy values the ability of batters to move runners around the bases taking into account (i) the state of the runners on base at any one point in time and (ii) the number of outs.\n",
        "\n",
        "### An Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "The example below shows the impact of a batter reaching first base in two different cases, (a) and (b). Suppose that in each case there is one out, but in case (a) there is a runner on second base while in case (b) there is a runner on third base. We want to compare the state of the game before and after the batter's hit.\n",
        "\n",
        "[hit%20and%20base%20states.PNG](attachment:hit%20and%20base%20states.PNG)\n",
        "\n",
        "In case (a), the batter reaches first base and the runner on second advances to third base as a result of the hit. No runs are scored, but the run potential of the new state is high given two runners on base with one on third. In case (b) the batter reaches first base and the runner on third scores, adding one run to the total. Evaluating the contribution of the batter in this context is not always intuitive. While the scoring of the run is valuable, and the batter should get credit for advancing the runner, he wasn't responsible for getting the runner to third base in the first place. After the play, the run potential in case (b) is much lower because there is now no runner on third, in constrast to case (a). Thus while the overall value of the hit in case (b) might seem much greater (because a run was scored), the lower run expectancy of the bases after the event will make the difference in the value of the hit much smaller.\n",

        "\n",
        "## The Run Expectancy Matrix\n",
        "\n",
        "Our goal is to place a value in terms of expected runs arising from a given event (out, single, double, etc). To do this we need to evaluate the run expectancy before and after the event - the value of the event is thus the change in run expectancy. We code each state by defining a matrix of possible states.\n",
        "\n",
        "[The%20RE%20matrix.PNG](attachment:The%20RE%20matrix.PNG)\n",
        "\n",
        "Thus the run expectancy matrix distinguishes 24 different states (contexts) for an event. We can refer to each possible state in terms of our code. Thus \"000 2\" means \"no runners on base and two outs\" or \"101 1\" means \"a runner on first and third with one out\". Instead of using a matrix, we can simply write down the possible states as a long list:\n",

        "\n",
        "In statistics, the concept of *expected value* refers to the value of all possible events weighted by the probability of that outcome. Furthermore, probabilities in statistics are usually identified with the frequency with which such events occur. Such probabilities are considered credible if they are calculated using a large numbers of observations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Run expectancy in a given state is calculated as the average of the number of runs scored from that state to the end of the inning, calculated from all events in a given season. In a Major League Baseball season there are typically around 200,000 events, which gives us some confidence in the reliability of the expected values.\n",

        "## Run Value and Run Expectancy\n",
        "\n",
        "There are many ways we can use the run expectancy matrix once we have calculated it. The most obvious is to value the contributions of the batters. Consider a particular at-bat. There is a run expectancy (RE) before the event and after the event, but there may also be runs scored as a result of the event. Thus, for that event we can credit the batter with a run value (RV):\n",
        "\n",
        "**RV = Runs scored + RE (after at-bat) - RE (before at-bat)**\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that RV may be both positive and negative. The contributions of a batter across a season can be calculated as the sum of the RVs of all their at-bats in a season."

An example here is a \"foul error\" - where a batter hits a fly ball into foul territory- and so cannot run - but also the fielder makes an error and does not catch the ball (if caught, the batter would be out). This is one type of event (a fielding error), but it does not change the base states or the number fo outs, so there is no impact on run expectancy.    \n",

        "2. **Innings that end with fewer than three outs.** If the visiting team is ahead after nine innings (i.e. before the bottom of the ninth starts), the home team can score the winning run and the game ends with fewer than three outs. This is true at the bottom of the ninth, and at the bottom of extra innings if the home team wins. Since these innings are truncated by the rules of the game, the potential runs scored to the end of the inning are also reduced. In order to compare like with like, we exclude these innings."
